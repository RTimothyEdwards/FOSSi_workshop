For workshop attendees working directly on a linux system, the VM
can be used, or one of the following solutions:

(1) Docker---Use the docker container from IIC-JKU:
	https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-MULTITOOL

    note that this is a large docker container as it contains
    multiple PDKs.

    Within the docker container, install CACE:
	python3 -m pip install cace

(2) Local install---Install the necessary tools and PDKs from sources
    locally.  Note that compiling the sky130 PDK can take a long time
    on a machine with few cores.  A pre-built PDK can be obtained from
    volare.

    Needed tools (essential):
	ngspice:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice
	magic:	https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic
	xschem:  https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem
	
    PDK:
	open_pdks: https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks
    (or)
	volare:  python3 -m pip install volare

After the tools and PDK are installed, get the example repositories:
